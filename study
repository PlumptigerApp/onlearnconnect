            "description": "Pennants are continuation patterns drawn with two trendlines that eventually converge. A key characteristic of pennants is that the trendlines move in two directions—one will be a down trendline and the other an up trendline. The figure below shows an example of a pennant. Often, the volume will decrease during the formation of the pennant, followed by an increase when the price eventually breaks out. A bullish pennant is a pattern that indicates an upward trending price—the flagpole is on the left of the pennant."

            "description": "Flags are continuation patterns constructed using two parallel trendlines that can slope up, down, or sideways (horizontal). Generally, a flag with an upward slope (bullish) appears as a pause in a down trending market; a flag with a downward bias (bearish) shows a break during an up trending market. Typically, the flag's formation is accompanied by declining volume, which recovers as price breaks out of the flag formation."

            "description": "Wedges are continuation patterns similar to pennants in that they are drawn using two converging trendlines; however, a wedge is characterized by the fact that both trendlines are moving in the same direction, either up or down. A wedge angled down represents a pause during an uptrend; a wedge angled up shows a temporary interruption during a falling market. As with pennants and flags, volume typically tapers off during pattern formation, only to increase once price breaks above or below the wedge pattern. Wedges differ from triangles and pennants in that they reflect only upward and downward price movements, so the wedge generally appears angled."
